# Clivia Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

## Overview

Clivia is a plant care and breeding companion app designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your data belongs to you.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Clivia operates entirely on your device. All information you enter—plant names, photos, care logs, breeding records, and measurements—is stored locally on your iPhone or iPad and never transmitted to us or any third party.

## What the App Stores (On Your Device Only)

- Plant information (names, species, colours, traits)
- Photos you take or select
- Care logs and milestones
- Breeding predictions and records
- Leaf measurements
- App preferences (hemisphere setting, appearance)

This data is stored in your device's local storage and is not accessible to us.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data** because we do not have access to it. Your plant collection remains completely private.

## Analytics & Tracking

Clivia does not include any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. We do not track your usage of the app.

## iCloud & Backup

Your Clivia data may be included in your device's standard iCloud or iTunes backups if you have these features enabled. This is controlled by your device settings, not by Clivia.

## Photos

When you add photos to your plants, they are stored locally on your device. Clivia requires camera and photo library access only to let you capture and select images for your plants. We do not access or transmit these photos elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services

Clivia does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

Clivia does not collect personal information from anyone, including children.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all Clivia data at any time by:
- Using the "Reset All Data" option in Settings
- Deleting the Clivia app from your device

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version within the app and update the "Last Updated" date.

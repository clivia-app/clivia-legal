## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Is my data backed up?**  
A: Clivia stores all data locally on your device. Your data is included in your device's standard iCloud or iTunes backups if you have these enabled in your device settings.

**Q: Can I sync between devices?**  
A: Currently, Clivia does not support cloud sync. Each device maintains its own plant collection.

**Q: How do I export my data?**  
A: Go to **Settings → Export Data** to create a backup file of your plant collection.

### Plants & Photos

A: Ensure Clivia has permission to access your Photo Library. Go to **Settings → Clivia → Photos** on your device.

**Q: Can I change a plant's photo?**  
A: Yes! Open the plant's detail view, tap on the current photo, and choose a new one.

### Breeding Predictions

**Q: How accurate are the breeding predictions?**  
A: Predictions are based on established Clivia genetics. Results show probability ranges, not guarantees. Actual offspring may vary.

**Q: Why does variegation only consider the seed parent?**  
A: Variegation is inherited through chloroplasts, which come only from the mother plant (seed parent). This is scientifically accurate.

### Seasonal Guidance

A: Go to **Settings → Location** and ensure your hemisphere is set correctly (Northern or Southern).

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app is running slowly.**  
A: Try restarting the app. If you have many plants with large photos, the app may need more memory.

**Q: I accidentally deleted a plant. Can I recover it?**  
A: Unfortunately, deleted plants cannot be recovered. We recommend regularly exporting your data as a backup.

**Q: The app crashed. What should I do?**  
1. Restart the app
